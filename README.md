### A Green Micro-Mobility Innovation
# The Idea - Why Kijani Bikeshare
Our bike sharing app is a comprehensive solution that leverages modern technology to provide an efficient and convenient way for users to commute. The app allows users to reserve bikes at nearby stations and drop them off at their desired location, making it an ideal choice for short commutes.
The front-end of the app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. This provides a seamless and user-friendly experience to the users. The back-end of the app is built using Flask/Python, which provides a powerful and efficient back-end framework for web development. Flask is a lightweight and flexible framework that makes it easy to integrate with other technologies.

To facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end, the app uses Axios, a popular JavaScript library for making asynchronous HTTP requests. This ensures that the app is fast and responsive.

The app also utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store user information and bike availability data. PostgreSQL is a popular and reliable open-source relational database management system that ensures data is managed securely and reliably.

To unlock bikes, the app utilizes QR codes. Users can easily scan a QR code on the bike with their smartphone camera to unlock it, making the process quick and seamless.

Additionally, the app allows users to input their start and drop-off points on Google Maps, providing added convenience and accuracy to the user experience.
